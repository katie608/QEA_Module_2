QEA Module 2  Faces Final project 
Emma Mack and Katie Foster

When artists make movie posters, they intentionally use color and structural elements to convey certain characteristics of the film, in order to market to people who would be interested in watching it. In order to explore whether computers can identify these graphic design elements, and attach them to meaning, we experimented with three different methods of classifying movie posters based off genre, specifically differentiating between Romance and Science Fiction movie posters. Our methods included simple cutoff based off average brightness of the image, using and eigenfaces approach on an image matrix including color, and using linear regression on an image matrix including color.
